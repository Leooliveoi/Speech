# Speech

It's a python tool that was created to help English students and professionals.

This tool will use the user's microphone to listen to words and phrases, write these as a keyboard key, and/or reproduce these words/phrases.

This tool can be used as a personal voice assistant as well, but custom codes will be necessary.

By default, I create this tool to help me to learn English pronunciation and conversation.

## Starting Speech

``` $ python3 speech.py ```

``` $ python3 -m PyInstaller speech.py ```

This tool uses the following libraries:

- speech_recognition
- pyttsx3
- pyautogui
- time
- sys
- os

If you want to export the code as .EXE you can use PyInstaller.

Observation. 

This is not the final code, a bunch of adjustment is necessary and some bugs need to be fixed as well.

Enjoy.
