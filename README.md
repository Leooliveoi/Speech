# Speech
Its a python tool that was created to help English students and professionals.

This tool will use the user's microphone to listen words and pharases, and write these as a keyboard key and/or reproducting these word/pharase.

This tool can be used as a personal voice assistant as well, but personal codes will be necessary.

By default I create this tool to help me to learn english pronunciation and conversation.

Enjoy.
